									Title IX is a section of the Education Amendments of 1972 that says people can not be discriminated against on the basis of sex in any educational program that receives federal funding. Although the law impacted other aspects of women's educational experience, it was not applied to cases of sexual assault until the Dear Colleague letter in 2011.

							The Clery Act was named for Jeanne Clery, a student who was raped and murdered in her dorm room at Lehigh University in 1986. The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, otherwise known as the Clery Act, requires all colleges and universities who receive federal financial aid to disclose their crime statistics in an annual report. Also requires the university to maintain a public crime log, provide timely warnings about crimes which pose a serious or ongoing threat to students and employees, and devise an emergency response, notification and testing policy.

							The Violence Against Women Act dedicated about $1.6 billion to investigating violent crimes like sexual assault carried out against women. It was the first major law to help government agencies and victim advocates work together to fight domestic violence, sexual assault, and other types of violence against women. It took measures to protect victims and created the Office on Violence Against Women within the Department of Justice.

The letter was a demand that colleges and universities adopt the lower burden of proof or risk federal investigation and potential loss of federal funding. This allowed students to file Title IX complaints when their cases were not handled properly by their college or university.

				<h2>Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act becomes law</h2>
				<em>March 6, 2013</em>
				<p>
				As part of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act further clarifies requirements of Title IX and the Clery Act. It outlines the rights of victims to report the crime to police and the guarantee of a fair and quick disciplinary process. It also expanded the definition of sexual violence to include dating violence and stalking, along with sexual assault.

				<em>January 22, 2014</em>
				<p>
					The White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault was established in January to address sexual assault in schools. The force issued its <a href="https://d28htnjz2elwuj.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/%2522Not-Alone%2522-Report-by-White-House-TAsk-Force-to-Protect-Students-from-Sexual-Assault.pdf">first report</a> in April titled "Not Alone". The <a href="https://www.notalone.gov/">Not Alone</a> campaign was launched in connection with the report. The report included a set of recommendations and best practices for student and administrative bodies. Since the launch, thousands of people have shared their stories and ideas about how best to eliminate sexual assault in schools.

					The Department of Education released <a href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-ix-sexual-violence-investigations">a list</a> of 55 colleges and universities under investigation for possible Title IX violations for mishandling sexual-assault cases. By April, that number had grown to 106 colleges and universities. The goal of the Title IX investigation is to ensure that the campus is in compliance with federal law, which demands that students are not denied the ability to participate fully in educational and other opportunities due to sex.

				<em>January 19th, 2015</em>
				<p>
					In April and May of 2014, the Association of American Universities surveyed students at 27 universities about their experiences with sexual assault and sexual misconduct, drawing responses from more than 150,000 students. The Campus Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct identified the problem of sexual assault on college campuses after the DOE released the list of colleges under investigation and the release of Not Alone. Results data found that about 12 percent of student respondents have experienced sexual contact without consent by physical force.
